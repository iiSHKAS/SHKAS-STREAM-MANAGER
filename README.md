#  SHKAS STREAM MANGER




## 💡 Program Idea

The app’s idea is to automatically change the stream category and title on the **Twitch** and **Kick** platforms according to the game currently running.

## ⚙️ How the app Works

### 3️⃣ Manually Adding Games

You can manually add games by:
- Selecting the game’s process (the game must be running).
- After selecting the process, the game name and category name will be automatically determined and suggestions for the game category will appear. Choose the appropriate category.

### 4️⃣ Automatically Add Steam Games

You can also automatically add games installed via **Steam**:
- Click the **“Add Steam Games icon”** button.
- You'll be taken to a new page where the app:
  - Scans your installed Steam games.
  - Detects the correct category if available.
  - Allows you to choose from similar categories if there are multiple options.
