### 4️⃣ Automatically Add Steam Games

You can also automatically add games installed via **Steam**:
- Click the **“Add Steam Games”** button.
- You'll be taken to a new page where the program:
  - Scans your installed Steam games.
  - Detects the correct category if available.
  - Allows you to choose from similar categories if there are multiple options.
